This project was to create a hangman game.

Below are a few screenshots of the project:

The technology that we used was an online free database, and PHP code hosted on a free hosting site. It was difficult trying to figure out how to use the various online sources, as the DevOps nature of this free tool was not easy, and some things took multiple days. But it was solvable and I got it working.

I worked on all the functionality, such as signining in, taking guesses, putting the hangman based on score they have, ending the game, and displaying their guesses.

Snippets of code I worked on are posted below:
