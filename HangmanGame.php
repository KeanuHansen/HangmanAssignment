<!-- We are going to make a hangman game -->
<!-- We need a login -->
<!-- We need to let them sign up or sign in -->
<!-- If they sign up they need to create a user and password, and confirmed password, if user already exists, tell them, if passwords don't match, tell them -->
<!-- If they sign in, it needs to validate, logs in and starts playing, if not right tell them to try again --> 
<!-- We have to hash the passwords -->
<!-- If they sign up, it should immediately start as though they are logged in --> 
<!-- We need to score them, and have a high score --> 
<!-- Score will be based by number of guesses, so it needs to count guesses -->
